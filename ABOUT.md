A note from the author*

I did my first iteration of this project in undergrad, as the final project of an AI course. My professor was this Russian mathematician, and when I gave my final presentation he said, "Stochastic cooling algorithm. Very impressive work Mister Heckbairt. But tell me one thing. Does it really rock?"

So I say, "with a due respect professor, prepare to be rocked harder than you've ever been rocked in your life." And I press the button on my laptop and out comes a  rockin' guitar line.

And my professor says, "I know this music. It is Joe Perry. We also have Aerosmith in Soviet Union times", and I'm all, shoot, wrong button. That was some of the training data. And then I press some other button and the my laptop starts rocking even harder than Joe Perry.

In the end I got a lousy grade because the lyrics were terrible. The public domain stops in the twenties, and you might think that feeding Moby Dick and Jane Austen into a third-order Markov chain generator might make for some killer lyrics, but I can assure you that it does not. So I ended up using the collected speeches of Malcolm X, which were passionate and vernacular, but he uses certain words to refer to certain segments of the American population that are not the words that people use anymore to refer to those segments. Which was awkward.

But then Twitter arrived on the scene, and the single greatest thing that it's done for our civilization is to put Jon Bon Robot back in the driver's seat.
